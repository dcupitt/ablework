# AbleWork

This repository is for the development of an inclusive web app for people with disabilities to connect with employment opportunities.

It is a project for the All-Summer Hackathon for the 1 Million Women to Tech Summer of Code.

All participants in the Summer of Code are invited and welcome to contribute to this project.

A to-do list will be maintained on this trello board: https://trello.com/b/cTUaZP2x

If you would like to see the to-do list, you will need to request to join the team on the board. You can also contact me in the 1 Millon Women to Tech discord if you wish to join the trello board and I will send you an invite.

The numbers on the trello board e.g. (3) are from scrum. These are to give the tasks rough numbers based on how long they will take / a time limit to place on them. There is a google chrome extension for trello and scrum numbers here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrum-for-trello/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje?utm_source=gmail
